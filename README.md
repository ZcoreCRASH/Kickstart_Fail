# Why Kickstarter Campaigns Fail: A Visualization using Python.

Kickstarter is a global crowdfunding platform, focused on creativity and merchandising. The company's stated mission is to "help bring creative projects to life".

This project is making simple exploration and a look around to the crowdfunding data in Kickstarter.

Financing a business involved asking a few people for big sums of money, Crowdfunding is turning this idea on its head, using the internet to help entrepreneurs talk to potential investors (backers) that each contribute a small amount.

Our goal is to evaluate the dataset and find the reason of success and failure of a Kickstarter. Detailed Description of the project is given in the Jupyter Notebook.
